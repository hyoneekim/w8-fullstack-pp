## üß† Overview

This project implements **user authentication and authorization** features using **JWT**, **bcrypt**, and **Express.js**. The authentication system protects CRUD operations on property routes, and all functionalities are validated through **integration tests** using **Supertest** and **Mongoose**.

## ‚úÖ Functionality Assessment

### **1. POST /api/users/signup**

**Grade:** 8.5/10  
**Improvements:**  
- Fix user existence logic:  
  ```js
  const userExists = await User.findOne({ username });
  if (userExists) {
      res.status(400);
      throw new Error("User already exists");
  }
  ```
- Correct test to check saved user by `username` instead of `email`.

---

### **2. POST /api/users/login**

**Grade:** 9.5/10  
**Improvement:**  
- Add test case for non-existent username.  
- Consider returning user role or profile data in response for frontend integration.

---

### **3. Protected Routes (Properties API)**


**Grade:** 10/10  
**Improvement:**  
- Add negative tests for missing or invalid tokens.  
- Consider moving token verification to middleware tests for modularity.

## üß© Code Quality Assessment

| Category | Score | Comments |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Readability** | 9/10 | Code is clear and logically structured. |
| **Error Handling** | 8/10 | Proper try/catch used, but error logic for existing user is incorrect. |
| **Consistency** | 9/10 | Consistent variable naming and token structure. |
| **Testing Thoroughness** | 9/10 | Covers all main authentication flows and protected endpoints. |
| **Code Maintainability** | 9/10 | JWT and bcrypt usage follow best practices; minor logical fix needed. |

---

## üß≠ Summary

The authentication and protected routes are well-designed and follow industry best practices. The tests effectively confirm that JWT-based protection works as expected. However, a few logical and consistency issues in the signup process prevent a perfect score.
